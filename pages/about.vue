          <h2>The Future</h2>
          <p>
            All business should look to the future, technology is a major part
            in the future of landscaping, it is ever expanding and needs to be
            constantly incorporated by its professionals to continue with
            customer demands and needs.
          </p>
          <p>
            Tools and equipment are getting more and more sophisticated, looking
            towards a digital future from apps to aid in stone masonry, to 3D
            computer assisted design. Not only is the business to keeping up
            with industry standards, but we hope to lean in to this new age and
            lead the pack, setting new best practices and paving the way for
            those to come.
